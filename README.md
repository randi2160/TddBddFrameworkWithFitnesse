This project provides a setup for the FitNesse Framework with examples to help you get started quickly with test automation. Originally started 8 years ago, it's now updated as a demo for those looking to adopt automation in their organizations.

Getting Started
1. Clone the Project
To get started, clone the project repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/randi2160/TddBddFrameworkWithFitnesse.git
2. Install Visual Studio Community Edition
You'll need Visual Studio Community Edition to work with this project:

Download Visual Studio Community Edition.
During installation, select the .NET desktop development and ASP.NET and web development workloads.
3. Open the Project in Visual Studio
Launch Visual Studio.
Go to File > Open > Project/Solution.
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the project (TddBddFrameworkWithFitnesse).
Select the .sln file and click Open.
4. Build and Run the Project
Press Ctrl + Shift + B to build the solution.
Ensure the build is successful with no errors.
5. Launch FitNesse
Navigate to the project folder and execute the runfitnesse.bat file to start FitNesse.

6. Configure FitNesse for Testing
Hereâ€™s a sample configuration to set up FitNesse with your DLL and perform reflection:

plaintext
Copy code
!|QaTip.Fitnesse.Demo.DoTestFixture|

!define COMMAND_PATTERN {%m -r fitnesse.fitserver.FitServer,FitSharp\fit.dll,FitSharp\fitLibrary.dll -c FitSharp\suite.config.xml %p}
!define TEST_RUNNER {Fitsharp\Runner.exe}
!path ..\FitnesseFramework\Fixtures\Fitnesse_Dlls\QaTip.Fitnesse.Demo.dll
FitNesse is capable of testing APIs, UI web services, databases, and more. If you can write the code, the possibilities are endless.

Example: NavigateTo Method in DoTestFixture
The NavigateTo method in the DoTestFixture class initializes a browser (if it hasn't been already) and returns a ManageNavigationFixture object, which is used to manage web navigation tasks in the test.

csharp
Copy code
public ManageNavigationFixture NavigateTo()
{
    InitializeBrowser(); // Initialize browser if not already done
    return new ManageNavigationFixture(selDriver);
}
This method ensures that the browser is only initialized when necessary and provides an interface to interact with the web page.

This version is more streamlined and user-friendly, providing clear instructions and explanations without unnecessary detail. It helps users quickly understand how to get started with the project and how the provided code works.
